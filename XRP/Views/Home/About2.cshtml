    <p>Larsen &amp; Toubro (L&amp;T), an Indian multinational conglomerate, operates in various sectors including real estate through its dedicated arm, L&amp;T Realty. With projects and partnerships spanning across approximately 50 countries, L&amp;T Realty hires online professionals and enables remote work to tap into a global pool of talent. This helps the company bring in specialized expertise in architecture, planning, project management, legal compliance, marketing, and digital real estate services without the need for physical relocation.</p>
    <p>The real estate sector is increasingly adopting digital transformation, with remote roles such as virtual site supervisors, 3D modelers, BIM engineers, real estate analysts, and digital marketing specialists becoming essential. L&amp;T Realty uses remote hiring to stay ahead by integrating technology and human expertise. It also allows the company to maintain 24/7 workflow, as remote teams across different time zones keep the progress continuous especially in global projects that require quick turnarounds and consistent updates.</p>
    <p>Another important reason for remote hiring in real estate is cost efficiency. By reducing the need for physical office presence in every country, L&amp;T Realty can cut down on operational expenses like office setup, site travel, and local staffing. Instead, that budget can be reinvested in quality professionals and better digital tools. In some cases, the company is even willing to pay higher rates for remote experts especially when the role is critical or time sensitive because high quality remote workers bring value through their independence, productivity, and technical skill.</p>
    <p>And when allowing remote working like this company can save much funds because the charges are lesser than when they are having physical office and permanent employees. When they are having remote workers company does not need to pay property charges/rentals, basic salary/ other incentives, utilities charges and etc. That's why the company can pay more commission for the remote workers</p>
